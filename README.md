# holochain-mutual-credit-clearing
A minimal mutual credit clearing currency implementation on holochain

## Overview
This project was inspired by Thomas Greco's book, *The End of Money and the Future of Civilization* and Holochain DevCamp. The focus of the DevCamp was on developing a game with the provided framework. However it was also mentioned that many applications have rules like games including currencies. Since I am more interested in currencies than games I decided to try and build one outside of the DevCamp provided game framework but using similar design patterns. The table below shows a credit clearing ledger with four agents transacting and was taken from *The End of Money and the Future of Civilization*.
